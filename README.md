## [Live Demo](https://dalux21.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

Assignment part of The Odin Project. The focus of this project was to learn how to use the module pattern in Javascript (Factories and IIFEs).

## Objective

Create a tic tac toe game where 2 players can play against each other on the browser (same machine). 

The purpose of this exercise is to put into practice what learned about factory functions and modules, hence using as little code as possible.

Optional: Allow the choice to play against the computer. 
Extra Bonus: Make the computer smart using an AI (minimax algorithm).

## Features
1 Player or 2 Players mode.

In 1 Player Mode, the app will generate a random name for the PC Player, from an array of Rick and Morty character names

in 2 Players Mode Two human Players get to choose their names and play on the same browser windows. 

The App will keep track of the scores and the user(s) will get a chance to have a rematch or start from scratch and go to the player selection screen.
Work in Progress: Make the PC Smarter with a minimax algorithm

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
